Description: Functions and methods for manipulating 'SNOMED CT'
    concepts. The package contains functions for loading the 'SNOMED CT'
    release into a convenient R environment, selecting 'SNOMED CT'
    concepts using regular expressions, and navigating the 'SNOMED CT'
    ontology. It provides the 'SNOMEDconcept' S3 class for a vector of
    'SNOMED CT' concepts (stored as 64-bit integers) and the
    'SNOMEDcodelist' S3 class for a table of concepts IDs with
    descriptions. The package can be used to construct sets of
    'SNOMED CT' concepts for research (<doi:10.1093/jamia/ocac158>).
